        Police said officers were continuing to "conduct a thorough and extensive investigation to establish the facts and circumstances around the incident".

Det Ch Supt James Dunkerley, from CTPNE, said: "We understand there are concerns around the incident, and questions about how and why this has happened.

"Our teams are committed to carrying out an in-depth investigation to provide answers to those affected."

Police were called to Otley Road just after 14:45 BST after reports of a man seen with weapons.

The Otley Run is an informal 19-stop drinking route spread over three miles along Otley Road and is popular with the thousands of students at the city's universities.

A crossbow and a firearm were recovered from the scene, police had previously said.

The 19-year-old victim underwent surgery after suffering life-threatening injuries and remains in a stable condition in hospital.

West Yorkshire Police's Ch Supt Steve Dodds said: "We fully appreciate the understandable shock and concern that this incident has caused in the Headingley community, and we are continuing to work closely alongside our partner agencies to support and reassure those living, working or studying in, or visiting the area."

The attack had prompted calls for better security around the route of the pub crawl.
